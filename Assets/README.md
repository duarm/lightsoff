everything in practice.

### How to Play

**Objective of the game:**
The game consists of a 5 by 5 grid of lights. When the game starts, a random number or a stored pattern of these lights
is switched on. Pressing any of the lights will toggle it and the four adjacent lights. The goal of the puzzle is to
switch all the lights off, preferably in as few button presses as possible.

"Save" to save the current setup.
